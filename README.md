# HitecDAS

Hi!Tec is a student group that is in charge of the welcome event for the new students in the campus. For the group and the institution is very important to know how many students are in the event.
Every 6 months we organized an event and we need to have a list of the students that assist to the event, also when the student register in the system we need to give him/her a color and a number that they will be the team for the rest of the day. 

For my proyect I used was the layer pattern because this project will increse in the next 2 years also I have the goal to use it in all the campus of the ITESM.
For the complex system you need to develop portions of the system idependently.
First I develop the part of the users and then I develop the part of the administrator, I create two modules named user and administrator in order to separete the functions and be clear of the funtions tha both can use.
A waknesses that I found doing the software like this is that are some functions that both uses and the complexity and layer increses with every type of user that it exist in the software.

I used the module design pattern, javaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components.
Also in the EJS design I used this design, I create separeted modules of web design and I reduse the ones that I could in diferent windows.
